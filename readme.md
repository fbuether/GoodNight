For now, the platform is still in development, so no public stories are available.

### Thanks

GoodNight is based on the excellent template for Scala.js/Play Framework template from ochrons, extended by jjcosare, found here:

GoodNight uses these tools:

* [Scala](https://scala-lang.org)
* Scala.js
* React
* Slick
